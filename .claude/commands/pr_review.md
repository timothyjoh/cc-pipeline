## 1. Git Analysis & Change Detection

### Automatic Diff Generation

<!-- AI Agent: Detect git state and generate appropriate diffs -->

**🔍 AI Agent Instructions:**

1. **Detect Current Branch:** Run `git branch --show-current` to identify current branch
2. **Generate Appropriate Diff:**
   - **If on `main`:** Run `git diff HEAD` to show uncommitted changes
   - **If on feature branch:** Run `git fetch origin main && git diff origin/main...HEAD` to show branch changes against latest main
3. **List Changed Files:** Run `git diff --name-only [appropriate-range]` to identify all modified files
4. **Categorize Changes:** Group files by type (components, pages, actions, lib, database, etc.)

### Git State Analysis

- **Current Branch:** [Branch name from git analysis]
- **Comparison Base:** [main HEAD / uncommitted changes]

## 2. Architecture Compliance Review

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Data Access Pattern Verification

**Review each backend change against architecture rules:**

#### Server Actions Compliance (`app/actions/[feature].ts`)

- [ ] **✅ Correct Usage:** Only used for mutations (POST, PUT, DELETE operations)
- [ ] **✅ File Structure:** Located in `app/actions/[feature].ts` files
- [ ] **✅ Directives:** All functions use `'use server'` directive
- [ ] **✅ Revalidation:** Mutations call `revalidatePath()` after data changes
- [ ] **❌ Violations Found:** [List any incorrect usage]

**Severity:** 🔴 **BLOCKING** - Must fix before merge

#### Query Pattern Compliance

- [ ] **✅ Simple Queries:** Direct database calls in server components for single table/basic WHERE
- [ ] **✅ Complex Queries:** Proper use of `lib/[feature].ts` for JOINs, aggregations, reused logic
- [ ] **✅ No Query API Routes:** No API routes created for internal data fetching
- [ ] **❌ Violations Found:** [List any incorrect patterns]

**Severity:** 🔴 **BLOCKING** - Must fix before merge

#### API Routes Analysis (`app/api/**/route.ts`)

- [ ] **✅ Valid Use Cases Only:** Only for webhooks, file exports, external API proxies, or public APIs
- [ ] **❌ Invalid API Routes Found:** [List any routes that should be Server Actions or lib functions]
- [ ] **✅ No Internal Data Routes:** No API routes for internal CRUD operations

**Severity:** 🔴 **BLOCKING** - Must fix before merge

### Component Organization Review

#### File Structure Compliance

- [ ] **✅ Component Organization:** All components in `components/[feature]/` directories
- [ ] **✅ Page Structure:** Pages only contain imports and component usage
- [ ] **✅ Route Files:** New pages have `loading.tsx` and `error.tsx` alongside `page.tsx`
- [ ] **❌ Structure Violations:** [List any incorrect file placement]

**Severity:** 🟡 **WARNING** - Should fix but not blocking

---

## 3. Database Safety Review

### Migration Safety Protocol

#### 🚨 CRITICAL: Down Migration Verification

- [ ] **Migration Files Present:** Any new files in `drizzle/migrations/`?
- [ ] **Down Migration Created:** For each migration, verify `down.sql` exists in subdirectory
- [ ] **Safety Checks:** Down migration uses `IF EXISTS` clauses and includes data loss warnings
- [ ] **Migration Applied Safely:** Verify `npm run db:migrate` was only run AFTER down migration creation

**If ANY database migration exists without down migration:**
**Severity:** 🔴 **BLOCKING** - NEVER merge without down migration files

#### Schema Change Analysis

```sql
-- Review any schema changes for:
-- 1. Breaking changes to existing columns
-- 2. Missing indexes on frequently queried columns
-- 3. Data type changes that could cause data loss
-- 4. Foreign key constraints that could fail
```

- [ ] **Non-Breaking Changes:** Schema changes are backward compatible
- [ ] **Index Optimization:** New frequently-queried columns have appropriate indexes
- [ ] **Data Preservation:** No risk of data loss during migration
- [ ] **❌ Issues Found:** [List any schema concerns]

**Severity:** 🔴 **BLOCKING** - Must resolve before merge

---

## 4. Code Quality Review

### TypeScript & Code Standards

#### Mandatory Code Patterns

- [ ] **✅ Early Returns:** Code uses early returns instead of nested if-else statements
- [ ] **✅ Async/Await:** Uses async/await instead of .then() chaining
- [ ] **✅ Error Handling:** Proper try/catch blocks for async operations
- [ ] **✅ Type Safety:** All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] **❌ Pattern Violations:** [List any code style issues]

**Severity:** 🟡 **WARNING** - Should fix for maintainability

#### Code Quality Checklist

- [ ] **Proper Error Handling:** All error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] **Comprehensive Comments:** Complex logic documented with comments
- [ ] **No Console Logs:** Development console.log statements removed
- [ ] **Dead Code Removed:** No commented-out code or unused imports
- [ ] **Empty Functions Eliminated:** Functions containing only `pass` or empty bodies removed
- [ ] **Unused Callbacks Removed:** Callback functions that serve no purpose deleted entirely
- [ ] **Consistent Naming:** Variables, functions, and components follow naming conventions

**🚨 CRITICAL DEAD CODE PATTERNS TO REMOVE IMMEDIATELY:**

- [ ] **Empty callback functions** - `def callback(): pass` → DELETE entirely
- [ ] **Unused initialization functions** - Remove, don't just document
- [ ] **No-op functions** - If it only contains `pass`, remove it
- [ ] **Placeholder functions** - Remove rather than keep with TODO comments

**Severity:** 🔴 **BLOCKING** - Dead code must be removed, not documented

- [ ] **❌ Responsive Issues:** [List any mobile usability problems]

**Severity:** 🟡 **WARNING** - Important for user experience

### Theme Support Verification

- [ ] **✅ Dark Mode Support:** All new components support both light and dark themes
- [ ] **✅ CSS Variables:** Uses theme CSS variables instead of hardcoded colors
- [ ] **✅ Dark Mode Testing:** Components tested in both theme modes
- [ ] **❌ Theme Issues:** [List any theme-related problems]

**Severity:** 🟡 **WARNING** - Required for consistency

### Accessibility Compliance

- [ ] **✅ WCAG AA Guidelines:** Components follow accessibility standards
- [ ] **✅ Semantic HTML:** Proper use of semantic HTML elements
- [ ] **✅ ARIA Labels:** Interactive elements have appropriate ARIA labels
- [ ] **✅ Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- [ ] **❌ Accessibility Issues:** [List any a11y concerns]

**Severity:** 🟡 **WARNING** - Important for inclusivity

### Context Usage & Prop Drilling Analysis

- [ ] **✅ Context Provider Utilization:** Components use available context providers instead of receiving props for already-available data
- [ ] **✅ No Duplicate Data Fetching:** Child components don't re-fetch data that parent layouts/providers already have
- [ ] **✅ Proper Hook Usage:** Components use context hooks when rendered inside corresponding providers
- [ ] **❌ Context Usage Issues Found:** [List components with prop drilling or unused context]

**Critical Context Providers to Check:**

- **UserContext (`useUser()`)**: User data (userId, email, userRole, subscription info)
- **UsageContext (`useUsage()`)**: Usage tracking and billing data
- **[All Other Context Providers]**: Check for any other context providers in the application

**Common Anti-Patterns to Flag:**

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Component inside UserProvider but receives user data as props
<UserProvider value={userData}>
  <ProfilePage user={userData} subscription={subscriptionData} /> {/* Unnecessary props */}
</UserProvider>

// ✅ GOOD: Component uses context directly
<UserProvider value={userData}>
  <ProfilePage /> {/* Uses useUser() hook inside */}
</UserProvider>

// ❌ BAD: Duplicate auth/data fetching when layout already handles it
async function ProtectedPage() {
  const user = await getCurrentUser(); // Layout already did this!
  const subscription = await getUserSubscription(); // Available in context!
}

// ✅ GOOD: Use layout's authentication and context
function ProtectedPage() {
  const user = useUser(); // From layout's UserProvider
  const { subscription } = useUsage(); // From layout's UsageProvider
}
```

**Detection Strategy:**

- [ ] **Scan for components inside providers** that receive provider data as props
- [ ] **Check protected routes** for duplicate authentication/data fetching
- [ ] **Verify context hook usage** in components rendered inside context providers
- [ ] **Look for repeated database queries** for data already available in context
- [ ] **Check all context providers**, not just UserContext/UsageContext

**Severity:** 🟡 **WARNING** - Reduces maintainability and performance

### Input Validation & Security

- [ ] **✅ Input Sanitization:** All user inputs properly validated and sanitized
- [ ] **✅ XSS Protection:** No potential XSS vulnerabilities in user-generated content
- [ ] **✅ SQL Injection:** All database queries use parameterized queries (Drizzle ORM)
- [ ] **✅ Authentication Checks:** Protected routes verify authentication properly
- [ ] **✅ Authorization Verification:** User permissions checked before sensitive operations
- [ ] **❌ Security Concerns:** [List any security vulnerabilities]

**Severity:** 🔴 **BLOCKING** - Must fix all security issues

### Data Exposure Analysis

- [ ] **✅ Sensitive Data Protection:** No passwords, API keys, or sensitive data in client code
- [ ] **✅ Server Action Security:** Server actions validate user permissions
- [ ] **✅ API Route Protection:** API routes (if any) implement proper authentication

## 11. AI Agent Actions

### Automated Fix Generation

**For each 🔴 BLOCKING issue found:**

**🔍 Project Type Detection:**

<!-- AI Agent: Detect project type first to choose correct template -->

- [ ] **Check for TypeScript/Next.js:** `package.json` + `tsconfig.json` + `.tsx` files
- [ ] **Check for Python:** `pyproject.toml` + `.py` files
- [ ] **Mixed Projects:** Multiple project types in different directories

**🤖 AI Agent Technology-Specific Escalation:**

#### **For TypeScript/Next.js Issues:**

> "I found [X] blocking issues in TypeScript/React code that need to be resolved before merging. Would you like me to create a new task document using `task_template.md` to systematically fix these TypeScript/frontend issues?"

#### **For Python Issues:**

> "I found [X] blocking issues in Python code that need to be resolved before merging. Would you like me to create a new task document using `python_task_template.md` to systematically fix these Python/backend issues?"

#### **For Mixed Project Issues:**

> "I found blocking issues in both TypeScript and Python code. Would you like me to create:
>
> - A `task_template.md` task for the TypeScript/frontend issues
> - A `python_task_template.md` task for the Python/backend issues"

**If user approves task creation:**

1. **Detect issue types:** Categorize issues by technology (TS/React vs Python)
2. **Create appropriate task document(s):**
   - TypeScript issues → `task_template.md`
   - Python issues → `python_task_template.md`
3. **Place in correct directory:** `ai_docs/tasks/` with appropriate numbering
4. **Include technology-specific scope:** All relevant issues for that tech stack

- [ ] **🔍 SCAN FOR**: Empty initialization methods with just comments
- [ ] **🔍 SCAN FOR**: Unused imports after function removal
- [ ] **⚡ ACTION**: DELETE immediately, don't suggest documentation updates
- [ ] **⚡ ACTION**: Remove associated imports when functions are deleted

**Example of Correct Dead Code Handling:**

```python
# ❌ WRONG RESPONSE: "Update documentation in empty function"
def initialize_state(context):
    """Initialize state - currently no-op as framework handles this."""
    pass

# ✅ CORRECT RESPONSE: "DELETE this function entirely"
# Remove the function, remove the import, remove the callback reference
```

### Quality Assurance

- [ ] **Double-Check Architecture:** Verify every backend change against the decision flowchart
- [ ] **Validate Git Analysis:** Ensure diff covers all actual changes
- [ ] **Confirm Issue Severity:** Verify blocking vs warning classifications
- [ ] **Review Fix Recommendations:** Ensure suggestions are technically sound
